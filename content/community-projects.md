Looking to get started with CNAB or maybe build on top of an existing project?
Here are some open-source projects and SDKs for you to use, or take a look the
[CNAB community repository][cnab-community] for additional assets that you can 
use in your own project.

# Tools

## Duffle
<a href="https://duffle.sh" alt="duffle"><img align="right" src="/img/duffle.svg" width="64px" /></a>
Duffle is a command line tool that allows you to install and manage CNAB bundles.

## Porter
<a href="https://porter.sh" alt="porter"><img align="right" src="/img/porter.png" width="64px" /></a>

Porter improves the bundle authoring experience by adding bundle dependencies and 
a declarative experience that understands how to translate CNAB into existing tools
such as Helm, Azure, etc.

# SDK
Just because you see one already listed for your language, don't let that hold you back!
Feel free to contribute to that SDK, or start your own.

## Go
_We are currently working on extracting a Go SDK out of the Duffle codebase_

## .NET
* [CNAB.NET](https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-netstandard)

## Python
* [CNAB](https://github.com/garethr/pycnab)
